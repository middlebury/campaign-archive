  <description>&lt;span&gt;Environmental Action&lt;/span&gt;

              &lt;h2&gt;  Connor Wertz ’22 came to Middlebury with an interest in the environment. He is leaving as an experienced environmental activist excited to be part of advancing the climate movement.
&lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;“As an environmental justice major, I’ve gained worlds of information and background that has helped me see the problem—and the many potential solutions—in a whole new light,” he says. “Helping to connect the disparate societal ills of our time to coherent and exciting visions of the future feels so rich and fulfilling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wertz is a member of the Sunday Night Environmental Group and SGA Environmental Sustainability Committee. He spent a summer interning at 350VT—the Vermont arm of 350.org, the organization co-founded by Schumann Scholar in Residence Bill McKibben and Middlebury students. Now, Wertz is a member of the 350VT board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wertz’s Middlebury experience was made possible, in part, by the Barefoot Family Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not being buried in debt has been the greatest gift of my college experience. It has given me the flexibility to take risks and find balance between what I want to do and what is needed of me. Opportunities like Middlebury can change the trajectory of people’s lives. I will not waste this experience.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Opening Doors for Others</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Opening Doors for Others&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;haquyenp@middl…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Wed, 05/04/2022 - 16:00&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;div class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
          &lt;div class="paragraph--lead lead"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;h2&gt;  Davis United World College Scholar Rachel Ochako ’11 has transformed childhood hardship into a lifelong mission of opening doors for others. She is currently deputy director of international programs at Africare.
&lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Growing Grassroots Development in Africa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hardship teaches you a lot,” says Rachel Ochako ’11, who was orphaned at age 13 in Kenya. “You learn that the only way out is to achieve as much as you can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachel understands acutely how transformative an education can be. She applied on a whim for a United World College (UWC) scholarship from her middle school in Kenya, not thinking she had much chance. When she heard the news that she would be sent to the UWC in Singapore, she was ecstatic. Two years at the UWC, learning and growing alongside peers from all over the world, changed Rachel’s life. She knew she wanted more global experience and to put her knowledge to use back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachel came to Middlebury as a Davis United World College Scholar. Since graduating from Middlebury with a degree in international studies/African studies, Rachel has worked with communities in sub-Saharan Africa, creating opportunities for others. As deputy director of international programs at Africare, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that focuses on village-based development, she specializes in health, agriculture and food security, women’s empowerment, and humanitarian assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community development work is complex, she notes, and requires as much listening as thought and action. “You have to keep an open mind, knowing people have different thoughts, approaches, experiences. You have to accept there are some things you won’t agree with. To figure out how to make things better, you have to have a conversation. This has been very important in my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t always have the solutions,” she says, “and sometimes you simply can’t meet all the needs of a community. But increasing access to food for people during the dry season or convincing pregnant mothers to get health checkups and reducing infant mortality—those are the rewards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middlebury’s liberal arts approach resonates in her work today. “Being able to take courses in sociology, economics, and French—that broad exposure was very important for me,” she says. I studied French and spent a year at Middlebury’s School Abroad in Senegal in West Africa, and most of the countries I work in are Francophone. Taking a macroeconomics class, while taking a class in sociology, showed me how to analyze national policy and determine how to put that in place at the local level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As her career develops, Rachel hopes to share her development skills and experience with other young professionals in Africa, so that people may learn from her work and improve lives in their own communities.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Connection Among the Stars</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Connection Among the Stars&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;yanderson@midd…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Wed, 05/04/2022 - 15:00&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;div class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
          &lt;div class="paragraph--lead lead"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;h2&gt;  A summer teaching science to refugee children showed Hannah Harris the power of language. A fellowship at the School of Korean has gave her the skills to advance international collaboration as a communicator for the International Astronomical Union.
&lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On a sweltering summer day in 2016, Hannah Harris stood before a group of children in the Softex refugee camp—an abandoned toilet-paper plant on the industrial outskirts of Thessaloniki, Greece—holding a blowup model of the Earth above her head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let’s pretend we’re all planets in the solar system,” she said to the children in English, then German. A young girl translated the English into Arabic; another the Arabic into Farsi. Beneath the unblinking watch of armed Greek soldiers, Hannah and the children marched in orbit around two five-year-olds holding up a deflated soccer ball as the Sun. Someone drop-kicked the Earth, and an improvised game of cosmic soccer ensued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was great fun,” says Hannah, “but our lack of a common language made it hard to keep the kids focused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just weeks earlier, Hannah had graduated from Wellesley College with a degree in astrophysics and a minor in Russian. In her senior year, Hannah had received a Madeleine Korbel Albright Fellowship, which included funding for a humanitarian project. Hannah chose to work in the Softex refugee camp, where she found opportunities to infuse moments of science into playtime with children.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;figure class="paragraph--quote"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;
                  &lt;blockquote class="quote quote__text"&gt;
            &lt;span class="quote--marks"&gt;
                Science is a powerful lens through which we can understand a society and through which we can direct our future.

            &lt;/span&gt;
                      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;“Astronomy is a powerful tool that can bring joy to children or become a platform for international collaboration and diplomacy,” says Hannah. Today, Hannah works as a science communicator for the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The IAU is the largest international organization of astronomers in the world. Among their active members is North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It blew my mind when I learned that there are astronomers in North Korea,” says Hannah. Further investigation revealed that North Korean scientists have collaborated with astronomers in South Korea, China, Europe, and Australia on research, offering an elusive glimpse into an otherwise largely inaccessible country. Hannah believes that continued diplomatic progress with North Korea is vital and that having a deeper understanding of their science is valuable. “Science is a powerful lens through which we can understand a society and through which we can direct our future,” says Hannah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many primary texts, academic research papers, and oral histories of Korean and Asian astronomy remain untranslated and omitted from Eurocentric narratives of science history and philosophy. With a summer at the School of Korean, Hannah can begin translating some of these works and recording the oral histories of North and South Koreans working together. Eventually, Hannah intends to design and curate a traveling exhibition on the history of astronomy in Korea and Asia, to debut at the upcoming IAU General Assembly in South Korea in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The onus shouldn’t always fall on my Korean colleagues to explain their science and culture in my native language,” says Hannah. “I want to use my place in the international scientific community to communicate North and South Korean astronomy as an explicit tool for peacebuilding.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Overcoming Medical Distrust</title>
  <link>https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/philanthropy-action/Medical-Distrust</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Overcoming Medical Distrust&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;yanderson@midd…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Sun, 05/01/2022 - 16:09&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;div class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
          &lt;div class="paragraph--lead lead"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;h2&gt;  As a doctor, Masiray Kamara always knew clear communication was vital. Now she is putting skills gained through a fellowship at the Language Schools to use in her practice to build deeper bonds and help her patients overcome mistrust in the medical system.  
&lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Masiray Kamara recalls being a “sickly child” while growing up in Sierra Leone. To diagnose her frequent stomach pains, doctors would gently probe her belly with their hands and prescribe a “magic syrup.” Soon she would feel better. “That always fascinated me,” says Masiray. “They would heal with their hands. That’s where my interest in medicine began.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Masiray also recalls the children in Sierra Leone whom doctors could not heal. “So many children died,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masiray left Sierra Leone for the United States with her parents when she was nine years old. Today, she is a pediatrician in East Orange, New Jersey, working primarily with underrepresented minorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest challenges Masiray faces in her practice is mistrust of the healthcare industry, particularly among Black people. She believes that studies such as the Tuskegee experiment, in which Black men with syphilis were observed over decades without any treatment to let doctors track the course of the disease, as well as the eugenics movement and the forced sterilization of Black women, have created suspicion and fear among Black Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;figure class="paragraph--quote"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;
                  &lt;blockquote class="quote quote__text"&gt;
            &lt;span class="quote--marks"&gt;
                I see the immense difference it makes when a patient can relate to me not only because of the color of my skin, but by connecting with me culturally.

            &lt;/span&gt;
                      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;“As an African American female from a first-generation West African immigrant family, I have strived as a pediatrician to combat medical mistrust,” says Masiray. “I want my patients to see a doctor who looks like them. I see the immense difference it makes when a patient can relate to me not only because of the color of my skin, but by connecting with me culturally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her New Jersey community, Masiray works with many French-speaking immigrants. Language can be her most important tool for diagnosis and connection. “Simply greeting a family and introducing myself in their native tongue makes a difference,” says Masiray, “but being able to freely converse in a common language can turn polite appreciation into a much deeper bond and understanding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masiray has a strong interest in global maternal and child health. In the future, she plans to return to West Africa and work toward strengthening health services and systems throughout primarily French-speaking countries. Like the United States, many African nations struggle with a lack of trust in government, institutions, and specifically health systems. Masiray hopes to mitigate distrust and strengthen access to health care in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For me as a doctor, clear communication is vital,” says Masiray. “Learning French will help me provide culturally sensitive health care and bridge the gap in racial health inequities.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Stories Worth Telling</title>
  <link>https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/philanthropy-action/access/leila-barghouty</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Stories Worth Telling&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;yanderson@midd…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Wed, 04/27/2022 - 16:12&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;div class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
          &lt;div class="paragraph--lead lead"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;h2&gt;  A fellowship at the Language Schools gave Middle East journalist Leila Barghouty a vital tool: the ability to communicate with the subjects of her stories without an interpreter.
&lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leila Barghouty had a decision to make when she graduated from Stanford with a master’s degree in journalism: work for a large news organization with broad reach and impact or have a small but significant effect on the lives of the people she wanted to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;“I wanted ownership over my stories,” says Leila. “I wanted to look people in the eye and tell them that we’ll do this the right way. We’ll make sure that you’re comfortable with how this story is told. And I promise to see it through from beginning to end.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leila’s work has appeared in or on Al Jazeera, National Geographic, CNN, Vice News, Slate, Forbes Middle East, and others. She focuses on investigations into law enforcement, the military, detention, and the long-term effects of armed conflict around the world. She regularly reports from the detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and across the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;figure class="media media--image media--contain-caption"&gt;&lt;img data-original-image-width="896" data-original-image-height="504" srcset="https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/400x225/public/2022-03/Middlebury_Thing-2022-Leila_Barghout-Photo.jpg?itok=m3N8FunL 400w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/640x360/public/2022-03/Middlebury_Thing-2022-Leila_Barghout-Photo.jpg?itok=yE8XLAQ7 640w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/832x468/public/2022-03/Middlebury_Thing-2022-Leila_Barghout-Photo.jpg?itok=daAoOYLU 832w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/1136x639/public/2022-03/Middlebury_Thing-2022-Leila_Barghout-Photo.jpg?itok=o8l4Cm0- 896w" sizes="(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px" src="https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/1136x639/public/2022-03/Middlebury_Thing-2022-Leila_Barghout-Photo.jpg?itok=o8l4Cm0-" alt="Destroyed building in the middle east" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="media__caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leila openly shares that her résumé is not as “decorated” as some of her peers’. She acknowledges that her work is not lucrative or stable. “But I do tell the stories that are important to me and worth telling,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leila traces her interest in storytelling back to her multicultural family. She came to appreciate language and culture while growing up in Greece and the United States with her Palestinian parents. The desire to translate between ideologies and cultures has been the catalyst, in particular, for her work covering the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leila came to the Arabic School thanks to recommendations from other journalists, who found that the school’s dedication to language was not only an art but a vital tool for effectively reporting on conflict in the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;figure class="paragraph--quote"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;
                  &lt;blockquote class="quote quote__text"&gt;
            &lt;span class="quote--marks"&gt;
                Being able to bridge the language gap on my own, without an interpreter, will allow me to tell stories that very few journalists seek to tell. It will allow me to make my subjects feel heard, respected, and, most importantly, not alone.

            &lt;/span&gt;
                      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Like so many Language Schools students, Leila has been frustrated and confused at times while trying to use her developing language skills to communicate in Arabic with teachers and fellow students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It really pulls at your gut to know somebody is trying to explain something to you and to not be able to understand them,” she says. “When you take away communication, there’s a visceral reaction.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parallels between her classroom experience at the Language Schools and her work as a journalist are not lost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Being able to bridge the language gap on my own, without an interpreter, will allow me to tell stories that very few journalists seek to tell,” says Leila. “It will allow me to make my subjects feel heard, respected, and, most importantly, not alone.” &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;h2&gt;  LeeCharles McNeil ’23 credits Middlebury with exposing him to viewpoints and belief systems that he’d never known existed. Here he reflects on how coming to Middlebury has changed him. LeeCharles is a recipient of the Barbara and John Tormondsen ’82 Scholarship.
&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;My name is LeeCharles McNeil, and I am a junior majoring in molecular biology and biochemistry. I would say I am a little different than most people who are at Middlebury for one simple reason: I am from Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vermont is essentially the polar opposite of Texas in almost every way. Among these different aspects are climate, topography, surrounding politics, and, the starkest difference, all four seasons. However, this difference is exactly what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Growing up, I was a big outdoorsman. I would camp, fish, hunt, and do all things outside. I grew up out in the country, and between my family property and neighbor’s, I was surrounded by cows, horses, pigs, dogs, and so on. This upbringing was stereotypically Texan, and I knew what Texas was and how impactful it was on who I grew up to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of a couple of family trips to different tourist destinations in the United States, I didn’t really know what other places in the U.S. were about—the lifestyles and the demands associated with them. Therefore, I wanted to see, learn, and internalize something different, which is why I chose Middlebury. It had what I wanted as far as outdoor access and student body size while maintaining my primary goal of being totally different.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;figure class="media media--image media--contain-caption"&gt;&lt;img data-original-image-width="1136" data-original-image-height="757" srcset="https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/400x225/public/2022-04/LeeCharles%20Fishing.jpeg?itok=380wRi39 400w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/640x360/public/2022-04/LeeCharles%20Fishing.jpeg?itok=suP3zXaG 640w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/832x468/public/2022-04/LeeCharles%20Fishing.jpeg?itok=Rii4c-XN 832w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/1136x639/public/2022-04/LeeCharles%20Fishing.jpeg?itok=zcRSrWoj 1136w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px" src="https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/1136x639/public/2022-04/LeeCharles%20Fishing.jpeg?itok=zcRSrWoj" alt="LeeCharles Holding a Fish he caught " /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="media__caption"&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The one hiccup in my plan with Middlebury, however, was cost. It is a small, private liberal arts college that comes with a high price. If it had not been for the generous financial aid package I was offered, I would never have been able to experience all that I have learned at Middlebury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things I am exposed to on a daily basis at Middlebury teach me so much. Every semester, so far, I have taken some type of sociology class in order to put myself into situations that force me to see, learn, and internalize something different. The viewpoints and belief systems that are expressed within these classes are something I never knew existed living in rural Texas, which is a testament to a Middlebury education. Middlebury has made me book smart and life smart.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>The Race Against Polio</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;The Race Against Polio&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;yanderson@midd…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Thu, 03/03/2022 - 14:11&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;div class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
          &lt;div class="paragraph--lead lead"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;h2&gt;  Scientist Ross McIntosh has been working to overcome antivaccination beliefs in communities experiencing polio outbreaks in Africa. Fluency in French—gained through a fellowship at the Language Schools—has helped him to overcome vaccine hesitancy.
&lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 1988, polio was present in more than 125 countries and paralyzed about 1,000 children per day. Thanks to a global eradication campaign and immunization efforts that have reached nearly three billion children, the incidence of polio has decreased by 99 percent since then. But polio is making a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus spreads from person to person and only affects humans; children are especially susceptible. Because polio has no cure, vaccination is the only way to protect children and stop the disease from spreading. Among the reasons for polio’s resurgence is false information about vaccines spread via social media and the Internet, which has fueled mistrust and vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Western and Central Africa, Ross McIntosh, a scientist with UNICEF, has been working to overcome antivaccination beliefs in communities experiencing polio outbreaks. “Many of these communities have experienced prolonged conflict,” says Ross, “which often creates antagonistic relationships with the national government.” The antagonism leads to distrust and a rejection of government initiatives, including polio vaccine programs.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;figure class="paragraph--quote"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;
                  &lt;blockquote class="quote quote__text"&gt;
            &lt;span class="quote--marks"&gt;
                It’s hard sometimes for aid workers to imagine how people in crisis want to receive support. If I can truly understand why people are refusing to get vaccinated, in their language, I can explain that to the people who make decisions about the polio vaccination program.

            &lt;/span&gt;
                      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Polio-affected areas are some of the most marginalized and underserved communities in the world. To build trust in these fragile environments, Ross and his colleagues spend time working with the national government, community leaders, health officials, and families to try and understand patterns of vaccine hesitancy and effectively inform vaccine-hesitant individuals of the dangers associated with avoiding vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to combatting polio with UNICEF, Ross worked in Afghanistan, conducting research on the success of state-building and development projects. “The lack of understanding of Afghans and Afghanistan on the part of foreigners, and a lack of language learning on the part of aid agencies, made many development projects at best ineffective, and at worst fuel for local conflict,” says Ross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of his experience in Afghanistan, Ross knew he needed to improve his French language skills to further his polio eradication efforts in Francophone Africa, and he determined that the Betty Ashbury Jones MA ’86 School of French would provide the intensity and rigor he required. A Kathryn Davis Fellowship for Peace supported his immersion in the language for eight summer weeks. Coursework in the French school gave him a firm foundation in grammar, and now he can work toward fluency on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard sometimes, I think, for aid workers to imagine how people in crisis want to receive support,” says Ross. “I think we quite often forget that apart from wanting food and vaccines, people also want to maintain their dignity. If I can truly understand why people are refusing to get vaccinated, in their language, I can explain that to the people who make decisions about the polio vaccination program.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
