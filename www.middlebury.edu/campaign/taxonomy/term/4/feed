        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As the D.E. Axinn Professor of English and Creative Writing, Jay Parini is a force in the Middlebury College writing community. Since joining the English department faculty in 1982, Parini has supported generations of students through his various writing workshops and courses. Parini has written over thirty books, ranging from poetry collections to biographical memoirs such as his recent &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/books/review/jay-parini-borges-and-me.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borges and Me: An Encounter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his time at Middlebury, Parini has also served as an academic advisor and mentor for students. Devin McGrath-Conwell ’18.5 is one of these students, and he sat down with Parini for a wide-ranging discussion about literature, learning, and loving Vermont.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following conversation has been edited lightly for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Devin) Let’s start at the source. How did you find your love of literature?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Jay) When I was 14 and 15, I used to wander into a library near my home in Scranton, Pennsylvania. There was a little old lady librarian named Mrs. Godfrey who kept feeding me books. She introduced me to Robert Louis Stevenson, Sir Walter Scott, Charles Dickens, and a bunch of the first writers I ever read. So I’d say that she got me interested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then…I was writing. From high school on, I was writing a lot of poetry and occasional stories. Even some movie scripts, but I was just messing around with it. So, I’ve been working in different genres pretty much since I was in high school, and certainly, in college I really got interested. So I’ve been reading and writing pretty much since the age of about 12 or 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you think poetry was the first place you gravitated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember reading Robert Frost when I was 15 for a class assignment, and I just absolutely fell in love with him. That made me think about the language of poetry, the music of it, the way poems lift off the page and stay in your brain. Prose is so amorphous. It doesn’t hit me as much as poetry does. It also helped early on that I went to church and listened to the poetry there. And Reading the Psalms and hearing them read. That kind of thing made a big impression on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your mentioning of class assignments makes me wonder. Do you feel there were certain teachers, professors, or other mentors that guided your passion?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m insanely lucky with my mentors. Going back to Mrs. Godfrey and two or three high school teachers who were just fabulous. Then in college, I had two or three teachers who were just fabulous. I was lucky all along. I’ve always had mentors. So, one of the themes of my life is having mentors and being a mentor. They go together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always understood that education, as they say, is a teacher on one end of a log and a student on the other end of a log. And that’s really all you need. Anything else is superfluous. The swimming pool, and the bubble where you can play tennis, and the football field, that’s all extraneous. All you need is the log and the student on one side and the teacher on the other and you’ve got your education. That’s the core.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that the nugget that drove you towards teaching as a profession?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. The fact that I had some good teachers early on made me think, &lt;em&gt;I want to do this&lt;/em&gt;. This is good. I like to talk to students. I mean, I still have mentors, believe it or not. I still talk to my old mentor from Scotland every week on the phone. He’s in his mid-80s now. So, that never ends. Well, it will certainly end at some point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big finish, as it were. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. We do all get to the very end, but I’m still amazed that I’m still in touch with my main mentor from Scotland, Tony Ash, all these years later. We talked on the phone for an hour yesterday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turning to Middlebury, what drew you here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, first of all, I very much wanted to stay in New England because of my love of Robert Frost. And my love of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. Those three figures were, in my early days, luminous, guiding writers in my head that I read over and over and over again. I reread Emerson’s essays endlessly. I reread Frost. I still do. I dreamed about Frost last night. I’m never too far from Robert Frost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I saw a job was available at Middlebury, I got very excited and applied for it, wanting to go here. And of course, over the years, I’ve stayed. Many times I’ve been tempted away. People have offered me jobs at other places. I could have on various occasions split and taken a job somewhere else, but I never wanted to leave Vermont. I want to be in this locale that feels comforting and inspiring to me. I like being around these woods and fields and mountains. So in the end, it’s the nature of New England that appealed to me.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has your named professorship played any part in your staying at Middlebury? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I think so. At one point when I really had some opportunities to go elsewhere. But the Axinn chair, which has with it a stipend for travel and a reduction in course load, was just enough to tip the balance to make it possible for me to stay here. So the Axinn professorship has been huge in keeping me at Middlebury all these years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It must also be special because I know you and Don Axinn were quite close.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s it, I mean, in fact, the Axinn Professorship was partly created through the work I did with Don Axinn and &lt;a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/robert-pack"&gt;Bob Pack&lt;/a&gt; [former Middlebury English professor]. I worked with Don in helping him to make the decision to fund the Axinn Center. We were playing tennis one day and it came up. He said, “What can I do for the college?” I said, “Why don’t you give us a new English department?” So it all grew out of that conversation,  and I worked with Don very closely. That was something, I feel like I had a personal hand in, I was hardly the only one, but I was in contact with Don constantly. We talked on the phone every week till he died. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll never forget, I was teaching the modern poetry class, maybe a year or two before Don died. In the middle of my class, Don walks into the room and I said to the class, “And here you are at the Axinn center, and here is the Axinn.” Don thought that was very funny, and the students were quite amazed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m glad you bring up class and students because obviously part of why I’m here is because I had the chance to take courses with you, be mentored by you, and become your friend.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know that something I was able to do, and many students have been able to do, is take both analysis and workshop courses with you. The writing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the academic study. What is the importance of doing both of those?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I just don’t even approve of creative writing programs where you’re not studying literature as well. I think any writer worth his or her salt has to be a reader and a sophisticated reader. I don’t have any preference. I like teaching both literature classes and creative writing classes. I feel both of them inspire me. But especially, I want to get back to teaching Whitman and Emerson and Thoreau and Frost and W.H. Auden and T.S. Eliot.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I remember reading Eliot’s “The Four Quartets” with you and absolutely falling in love. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I love teaching “The Four Quartets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remembering that course takes me back to your image of a teacher and a student on a log. The importance of mentorship in teaching for you. So, this far into your teaching and writing career, what keeps driving you to seek out those relationships?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a mentor gets a lot back. You know what I mean? It’s a give and take. I mean, it’s not just delivering a lecture. You know you’re in a relationship with the people you’re teaching and it’s a two-way street. They’re teaching me as much as I’m teaching them. I have no sense of or belief in that the professor is superior. In any class, I consider myself a &lt;em&gt;primus inter pares&lt;/em&gt;, first among equals. We’re all equal and we’re all just learning and reading. I’ve got more experience and I’ve been around a long time so I have some insights to add, but the students are often a lot smarter than I am. I’m very aware of that and grateful for being around students who have insights that surprise me continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it keeps me awake. It’s all about being awake. And also it’s lovely. It’s wonderful to be present with people and for them to feel you and you to feel them. It’s why teaching has been very central to my life. It’s not something additional. Teaching is at the center of my writing life, ironically. People say, “How is it you can write and teach at the same time?” I don’t know how you do them separately. I mean, I don’t know how I would’ve written if I hadn’t been teaching all these years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On that writing life, we’ve talked about why poetry, but I want to jump back and ask about some of the other forms. I never knew you played around with screenwriting as a teen, but I know especially in the last 15 to 20 years you’ve worked on a lot of screenwriting. In that form and beyond, what’s the draw to keep pushing into and experimenting with different formats?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s exciting to move into a new area and learn new stuff. And also, it’s all writing. You just apply your skills in different ways. I’m finished with writing straight biographies. I did &lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780805063417/robertfrost"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; and [John] &lt;a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/9780805016734"&gt;Steinbeck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/one-matchless-time-jay-parini/1110856872"&gt;William Faulkner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/226167/empire-of-self-by-jay-parini/"&gt;Gore Vidal&lt;/a&gt;. Those are straight biographies and they are extremely hard work, almost more than I could stand these days. Nowadays, I’d rather write novels about writers or write screenplays because I like the dramatic mode of screenplays. I’ve also come to really appreciate the collaborative aspect of screenwriting and movie-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had such a great time in 2017 on the set of the Gore Vidal movie. The director, Mike Hoffman. The producer, Andy Patterson. Michael Stuhlbarg and the rest of the cast. We all became a family. We spent four months together on the set in Italy. I was behind the camera with the director for every single take. I learned a huge amount about how movies are made. This of course all came after working for 20 years on &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0824758/"&gt;adapting &lt;em&gt;The Last Station&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this to say that since I’ve been producing movies as well as writing them I’ve grown my understanding of how they’re made. I’ve been involved with figuring out how to raise the money with other producers I work with and I’m doing that right now. I’ve got three movies and two TV series in the works. I have one consistent co-writer and two I often work with as well. We work together on scripts and producing and so it’s terrific.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You used the phrase, “It’s all about being awake” earlier on. Would it be fair to say that your teaching and writing lives are just one life of continued growth and learning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I don’t make a distinction. My students these days are very interested in narrative, in dramatic narrative. They’re all interested in movies, and TV series. That’s where a lot of the energy and the culture have gravitated toward. Therefore, it’s kind of exciting to work in areas where there’s a lot of interest. I’m able to talk to a lot of students about the work I do, and I think they benefit from being in touch with somebody who’s actually doing the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh absolutely. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right? I mean, that’s good. The fact that I’m actually physically making movies and publishing novels and publishing poems is giving them something. They see how it’s done. They see how the sausage is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A full backstage pass to the logistics of a creative life. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s often not pretty, but it’s a process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over the decades you’ve spent time with generations of Middlebury students. Is there anything that strikes you about the way that either the students in your courses or the college, in general, have changed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What stands out is that a college is not a static place. I think that Middlebury’s core thing is the student talking to the teacher and the teacher getting something from the student. The student and the teacher on the log. It’s an exchange going back and forth. Even in the classrooms, the classes are relatively small, but you talk to the students outside of class. I think most of my teaching has always been done outside of class. The actual classes are just the formal structure that allows you to have relationships outside of the class where you do the real teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hours you spend behind the desk in the classroom are minimal compared to the work you do talking to students in your office, in the coffee shop, in the streets, in the gym, whatever. It’s a continuous conversation you’re having. I just had a thousand-word email yesterday from a guy that graduated and did his thesis with me 25 years ago. He’s coming by for a cup of coffee next week and wants to talk about something he’s working on. So, I’m still in conversation with students over many, many years. They’re often sharing their work with me throughout a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my memory of Middlebury is my memory of interactions with particular students over the years. That is the core and anything else is just extraneous. I think Middlebury should never lose sight of the fact that this is its mission. This is where its values should lie. I mean, if anything, let’s get rid of the buildings and put a bunch of logs out in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well as someone who has been lucky enough to be on that log with you, I extend a heartfelt thank you from all of us who have been and will continue to be there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love being on that log. Of course, it’s metaphorical, but it’s also real. It’s the job, it’s the work. It’s the work of knowing and you learn in so many ways. It’s also the work of community. Middlebury is about community. We all know each other, we talk, it goes on and on. It really is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Tue, 05/03/2022 - 16:08&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;div class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
          &lt;div class="paragraph--lead lead"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;h2&gt;  What began as an attempt by Matthew Evan Taylor to collaborate with fellow musicians during the isolation of the pandemic ended up being a yearlong project that culminated in an evening performance at the Met.
&lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The past two years, during the COVID pandemic, have been a time of stress and sorrow for many people. But in some ways, the unusual circumstances have also provided a time for reflection. Matthew Evan Taylor, assistant professor of music, used the time for exploration of his art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the lockdown, I began a process of giving myself permission to be who I am musically. People know me as an improvisor, but in the past I would put it as a secondary thing. I’m a composer and an improvisor—I got this other thing here that some people think is cool, but other people are scared of.” He laughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was improvisation that spurred his project &lt;a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/events/programs/met-live-arts/postcards-to-the-met"&gt;Postcards to the Met&lt;/a&gt;. Several years ago, he conceived of a plan where he would find random places to play his saxophone and he would record himself. He would send the recording off to friends who would then find random places to play and send a recording back to him—as if they were exchanging postcards. Taylor wanted to see how different the two environments sounded from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;figure class="paragraph--quote"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;
                  &lt;blockquote class="quote quote__text"&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;
                Something that is little taught but that is vital to sustaining our creative life is the ability to adapt quickly and to change with the times. You’re disrupting in a way that you can sustain yourself and you can become a new model for others.

            &lt;/span&gt;
                      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Live Arts Department and the Metropolis Ensemble, an avant-garde orchestra led by Andrew Cyr, began talking with Taylor about doing an evening-length work to commemorate celebrations of the spring; it was intended to premiere in March 2020. When that event didn’t happen, a conversation about doing the piece resumed in early 2021, and plans were made to premiere it in March 2022. Taylor explains, “But we needed to do something in the meantime to help with content for the Met Live Arts and generate interest in the evening performance itself. That’s when I presented my postcards idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the brainstorming sessions that followed, the idea transitioned into something other than what Taylor had envisioned. The original plan was for Taylor to improvise in outdoor locations and be videotaped once a month for the 12 months leading up to March. But as he says, “Quickly, practicality caught up to creativity.” The postcard idea had evolved into a more complex project with more of a structure than he’d originally thought, even though the goal was still to produce a series. But in the end, the main element was that he would be improvising an introductory piece and sending what he called “the greeting” to other musicians, who would then respond with their own musical creation. The plan was to interact in the postcard series with the musicians who would be a part of the full-length evening performance slated for March.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;figure class="media media--image media--contain-caption"&gt;&lt;img data-original-image-width="896" data-original-image-height="500" srcset="https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/400x225/public/2022-04/Matthew%20Taylor%20Playing%20Piano.jpg?itok=TwqXuu6K 400w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/640x360/public/2022-04/Matthew%20Taylor%20Playing%20Piano.jpg?itok=G0uHkFhq 640w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/832x468/public/2022-04/Matthew%20Taylor%20Playing%20Piano.jpg?itok=exIxi9pI 832w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/1136x639/public/2022-04/Matthew%20Taylor%20Playing%20Piano.jpg?itok=Ai39tBJB 896w" sizes="(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px" src="https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/1136x639/public/2022-04/Matthew%20Taylor%20Playing%20Piano.jpg?itok=Ai39tBJB" alt="Matthew Taylor Playing Piano" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="media__caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Taylor was excited to be working with the talented members of the Metropolis Ensemble orchestral collective and the South Asian jazz collective RAJAS, led by Rajna Swaminathan. And contrary to his first conception of the postcards, it wouldn’t be two artists improvising freely without any kind of feedback from each other but rather a more scripted series. He realized some ensemble members weren’t comfortable just improvising but needed more instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;figure class="paragraph--quote"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;
                  &lt;blockquote class="quote quote__text"&gt;
            &lt;span class="quote--marks"&gt;
                I decided I would improvise my performance, but then I would create scores for each postcard, laying things out in a way that could at least visually give the other musicians an idea of what they could do around what I was playing.

            &lt;/span&gt;
                      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Each postcard took a team to produce. Taylor hired Sam Kann ’21 as his videographer, and she offered good editorial advice on the video. Andrew Cyr managed the finances of the whole project and hired other team members, including Chris Botta, who was the sound and visual editor. While Taylor would do a lot of the musical editing with feedback from others, including Cyr, Botta would need to figure out how to edit the video together to reflect the musical flow and come up with an interesting visual palette. Another visual bonus was the addition of art created by the Juniper Creative team, which includes artist Will Kasso and Jennifer Herrera Condry. As a finishing touch, Taylor was asked to write a note about each postcard. He was inspired to write poems. “That was a fun little creative offshoot that I wasn’t expecting,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire project, from the postcards to the evening performance, ended up being a complementary combination of Taylor’s musical talents as improvisor and composer. Even while he was creating his improvisations for the postcards, he was working on the final performance, his postcard work inspiring his composition. “I really had to work hard at giving myself permission to do things in different ways. I was kind of hung up on trying to create a piece that was directly echoing the postcards, following some sort of similar trajectory.” He realized that wasn’t the way to go. The postcards were more for reference. “Kind of like when I was trying to read Latin in college. Just keep the Latin dictionary and the Latin text open side by side and go back and forth.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;figure class="media media--image media--contain-caption"&gt;&lt;img data-original-image-width="1136" data-original-image-height="639" srcset="https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/400x225/public/2022-05/sonic-sound-dance.jpg?itok=fXkLDJWZ 400w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/640x360/public/2022-05/sonic-sound-dance.jpg?itok=UPbG5gDc 640w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/832x468/public/2022-05/sonic-sound-dance.jpg?itok=N2X0J9wx 832w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/1136x639/public/2022-05/sonic-sound-dance.jpg?itok=8Z_o3Gjk 1136w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px" src="https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/1136x639/public/2022-05/sonic-sound-dance.jpg?itok=8Z_o3Gjk" alt="Students using movement while Matthew Taylor plays piano." /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="media__caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Throughout both the postcard series and the creation of the evening performance, Taylor and his collaborators were exploring African American, South Indian, and Western European musical practices. When Taylor began to think about the foundation of the long piece, he decided he wanted to see what it would be like to have a drone, or a low note that plays for a long time throughout the composition. South Indian performances are supported by drones, so it seemed a good fit. For the more active, unpredictable part of the performance, his reliance was on improvisation from the ensemble. The intent of the piece was meant to be a celebration of the return of the light and life of springtime. The narrative structure would begin with the unordered, improvised first movement with no meter for the audience to grab onto, reflecting the unsettling darkness of winter; then it would become more celebratory as life and light returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Taylor feels like he has succeeded in what he was trying to accomplish as a musician. “It’s an hourlong piece, the longest I’ve ever written, and it contains so many things I hear in my head. It’s guided by so many principles that I’ve developed about music creation and about improvisation.” On the practical side, creative length is not so daunting for his writing as it would have been in the past. And he has evidence now that people are going to take his writing and creativity seriously. For him, it’s a milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s not sure the isolation of the pandemic was solely the reason he has reached this point in his musical life, but he feels it accelerated the process. “Something that is little taught but that is vital to sustaining our creative life is the ability to adapt quickly and to change with the times. You’re disrupting in a way that you can sustain yourself and you can become a new model for others. So, yeah, this has been a really fruitful time for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Mon, 05/02/2022 - 16:08&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;div class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
          &lt;div class="paragraph--lead lead"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;h2&gt;  Geoff Brown ’99, former chief information security officer for New York City and leader of NYC Cyber Command, is sharing his expertise in defending against digital crimes as a professor of cybersecurity in the &lt;a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/academics/degree-programs/nonproliferation-terrorism-studies"&gt;Nonproliferation and Terrorism Studies&lt;/a&gt; program at the Middlebury Institute.
&lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity, Brown says, is closely tied to “things people don’t always think about, like continuity of operations. There’s a whole concept of resilience, which I think permeates a lot of our national and international discussion now, and it should and could be applied to food supplies, pandemic response, disaster recovery from weather events. And it certainly applies to cybersecurity in a very significant technical way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his Institute &lt;a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/people/geoff-brown"&gt;profile page&lt;/a&gt;, Brown’s courses are described as looking at “how pervasive technology, with criticality ranging from leisure activity to life safety, creates a new landscape for criminality, espionage, militarism, and activism, and accordingly, if left unprotected, can threaten the very underpinning of how we interact in the global community.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;figure class="paragraph--quote"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;
                  &lt;blockquote class="quote quote__text"&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;
                If we try to address cybersecurity internationally, strictly through a technology lens, then we’re ignoring the fact that cybersecurity events only happen because people do things.

            &lt;/span&gt;
                      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brown says he tries to give his students a fuller picture of the kinds of people needed in cybersecurity. “It’s not all people who speak ones and zeroes… . It’s incredibly important for people not to be afraid of this discipline because they associate it with technology.” Pointing to himself as an example—he majored in American literature—he says, “I am not a scientist, you know?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He doesn’t discount the importance of technology experts in the field, but he wants students to understand there is just as much need for people who understand human behavior. “If we try to address cybersecurity internationally, strictly through a technology lens, then we’re ignoring the fact that cybersecurity events only happen because people do things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown’s classes offer practical experience as well as theory. He’s taught the basics of setting up a cybersecurity shop inside an organization. Students have role-played a tabletop exercise based on an actual incident that he dealt with in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;figure class="paragraph--quote"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;
                  &lt;blockquote class="quote quote__text"&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;
                Every day that I show up, I’ll bring to the students the ability to have a conversation about what’s actually happening.

            &lt;/span&gt;
                      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;“Every day that I show up, I’ll bring to the students the ability to have a conversation about what’s actually happening. And then over time, they’ll help me figure out the best ways to communicate that. That’s a two-way street, and I’m learning myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Institute, Brown is also involved with the &lt;a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/academics/centers-initiatives/cyber-collaborative"&gt;Cyber Collaborative&lt;/a&gt;, which an umbrella for anything cyber-related at MIIS. And he’ll be helping a team prepare for the &lt;a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/scowcroft-center-for-strategy-and-security/cyber-statecraft-initiative/cyber-912/"&gt;Cyber 9/12 Strategy Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, an annual event sponsored by the Atlantic Council that challenges student teams from around the country and internationally to respond to a mock cyberattack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to his work at MIIS, Brown rejoined the private sector in January 2022 as an executive with the intelligence and cybersecurity company Recorded Future in the capacity of vice president for Global Intelligence Platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the human side of cybersecurity that fascinates Brown. “It’s about helping,” he said. “A way to think about it is that there’s a lot of information out there, and information should be distilled so that people can make the best decisions they can based on the uncertainties we face … that’s what the whole game is.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;figure class="paragraph--quote"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;
                  &lt;blockquote class="quote quote__text"&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;
                Like anything else in life, it’s about, can you be clear? Can you be concise? Can you communicate? And are you comfortable making decisions when frankly you don’t have all the facts?

            &lt;/span&gt;
                      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brown credits a combination of his work experience and strong communication skills for his ability to run highly technical teams in the cybersecurity world. “Like anything else in life,  it’s about, can you be clear? Can you be concise? Can you communicate? And are you comfortable making decisions when frankly you don’t have all the facts? You may not have half the facts, but you’ve still got to make a call.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is able to bring a narrative structure to situations that complements the technical side of the work. “I think in storylines. And to a certain extent, that is helpful when surrounded by engineers. Engineers think in ones and zeroes. They think in math. They think in science. They think in problem solving and experimentation. But I can wrap a story around all of that and divine a direction.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;h2&gt;  Middlebury plans to make data science a fundamental part of a liberal arts education. A new initiative, midd.data, will ensure all students understand and can use data and digital tools and techniques to create knowledge, regardless of their majors.
&lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Middlebury Economics Professor Caitlin Myers watched as 60 students new to data science got their feet wet in a new interdisciplinary course called Data Science Across Disciplines last January term.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;“It was so exciting to see them light up as they imagined how they could use the data for their projects,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with History Professor Kathryn Morse, Myers is directing an initiative titled midd.data with a goal of making digital methods and data science lessons widely available to students, regardless of their intended major. “Every student needs the tools to understand where sets of data come from, how reliable they are, and what truths they can tell,” Myers says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can’t turn around without seeing data used and misused,” Myers says. “If we’re going to train our students to be rigorous and critical engaged citizens, then data literacy is as fundamental to that as reading and writing fluency.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;figure class="paragraph--quote"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;
                  &lt;blockquote class="quote quote__text"&gt;
            &lt;span class="quote--marks"&gt;
                We’re way ahead in thinking in this really innovative way about data science as a fundamental part of a liberal arts education

            &lt;/span&gt;
                      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;During last winter’s J-term class, students spent mornings learning the tools of data science from Math Professor Alex Lyford. In the afternoons, they put those tools to use under the guidance of professors in their own fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art history students created a searchable database to glean information about the cost and origin of 17th-century textiles, which shed new light on portrait subjects in the Dutch Golden Age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students studying Japanese scoured films, articles, and songs to examine the use of Japanese linguistic expressions. Economics students tracked the impact of abortion policies over time. Biology students studied variation in forest ecology and tick populations and tick-borne diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;figure class="media media--image media--contain-caption"&gt;&lt;img data-original-image-width="832" data-original-image-height="545" srcset="https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/400x225/public/2022-03/Abortion-Atlas-%28Caitlin-Myers-Midd-Data%29-832.jpg?itok=3Qlln5-e 400w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/640x360/public/2022-03/Abortion-Atlas-%28Caitlin-Myers-Midd-Data%29-832.jpg?itok=XgiVTgyv 640w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/1136x639/public/2022-03/Abortion-Atlas-%28Caitlin-Myers-Midd-Data%29-832.jpg?itok=aM6a90vO 832w" sizes="(max-width: 832px) 100vw, 832px" src="https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/1136x639/public/2022-03/Abortion-Atlas-%28Caitlin-Myers-Midd-Data%29-832.jpg?itok=aM6a90vO" alt="Charts showing data about the locations of abortion facilities." /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="media__caption"&gt;

    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The J-term course will be offered again next winter, this time drawing in undergraduates who are studying animation, sociology, and other disciplines. Myers hopes to add more sections of the popular course and reach more students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of a generous donor, plans are in the works to offer a summer credit-bearing data science introductory class for incoming students from underrepresented backgrounds before they start their first semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middlebury is not alone in teaching data literacy, but Myers says she’s learned through networking with other institutions that the College is at the forefront of integrating it across academic disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re way ahead in thinking in this really innovative way about data science as a fundamental part of a liberal arts education,” she says. “I don’t know of another school in which a data science initiative is being spearheaded by faculty from across the curriculum.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;h2&gt;  LeeCharles McNeil ’23 credits Middlebury with exposing him to viewpoints and belief systems that he’d never known existed. Here he reflects on how coming to Middlebury has changed him. LeeCharles is a recipient of the Barbara and John Tormondsen ’82 Scholarship.
&lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;My name is LeeCharles McNeil, and I am a junior majoring in molecular biology and biochemistry. I would say I am a little different than most people who are at Middlebury for one simple reason: I am from Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vermont is essentially the polar opposite of Texas in almost every way. Among these different aspects are climate, topography, surrounding politics, and, the starkest difference, all four seasons. However, this difference is exactly what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;

              LeeCharles rushes for a touchdown during a Middlebury College football game. He has been a running back for the squad since coming to campus. (&lt;em&gt;Photo courtesy of LeeCharles McNeil&lt;/em&gt;)

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Growing up, I was a big outdoorsman. I would camp, fish, hunt, and do all things outside. I grew up out in the country, and between my family property and neighbor’s, I was surrounded by cows, horses, pigs, dogs, and so on. This upbringing was stereotypically Texan, and I knew what Texas was and how impactful it was on who I grew up to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of a couple of family trips to different tourist destinations in the United States, I didn’t really know what other places in the U.S. were about—the lifestyles and the demands associated with them. Therefore, I wanted to see, learn, and internalize something different, which is why I chose Middlebury. It had what I wanted as far as outdoor access and student body size while maintaining my primary goal of being totally different.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;figure class="media media--image media--contain-caption"&gt;&lt;img data-original-image-width="1136" data-original-image-height="757" srcset="https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/400x225/public/2022-04/LeeCharles%20Fishing.jpeg?itok=380wRi39 400w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/640x360/public/2022-04/LeeCharles%20Fishing.jpeg?itok=suP3zXaG 640w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/832x468/public/2022-04/LeeCharles%20Fishing.jpeg?itok=Rii4c-XN 832w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/1136x639/public/2022-04/LeeCharles%20Fishing.jpeg?itok=zcRSrWoj 1136w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px" src="https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/1136x639/public/2022-04/LeeCharles%20Fishing.jpeg?itok=zcRSrWoj" alt="LeeCharles Holding a Fish he caught " /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="media__caption"&gt;
              LeeCharles holds up a fish he caught before releasing back into the water, a regular occurrence at this pond that is his second home while at Middlebury. (&lt;em&gt;Photo by Devin McGrath-Conwell&lt;/em&gt;)

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The one hiccup in my plan with Middlebury, however, was cost. It is a small, private liberal arts college that comes with a high price. If it had not been for the generous financial aid package I was offered, I would never have been able to experience all that I have learned at Middlebury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things I am exposed to on a daily basis at Middlebury teach me so much. Every semester, so far, I have taken some type of sociology class in order to put myself into situations that force me to see, learn, and internalize something different. The viewpoints and belief systems that are expressed within these classes are something I never knew existed living in rural Texas, which is a testament to a Middlebury education. Middlebury has made me book smart and life smart.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Safer Vermont Schools</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Safer Vermont Schools&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;yanderson@midd…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Tue, 02/01/2022 - 17:43&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;div class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
          &lt;div class="paragraph--lead lead"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;h2&gt;  During the summer of 2021, Evelyn Lane ’23 worked with a Middlebury professor on a research project examining lead levels in water at schools across Vermont. In conjunction with a 2019 Vermont law focused on lead, her work has resulted in safer water supplies throughout the state.
&lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A junior environmental chemistry major, Evelyn Lane ’23 worked with Professor Molly Costanza-Robinson to analyze the impact of Vermont’s school lead laws. The following is Evelyn’s reflection on the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn:&lt;/strong&gt; My research partner and I worked on determining the impact of the 2019 Vermont law that concerns lead testing and remediation in schools. Through discussions with the Vermont Department of Health and Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, we organized and analyzed a database that is essential to determining how Vermont’s lead laws have affected children’s blood lead levels. You can read the&lt;a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2020/Docs/ACTS/ACT066/ACT066%20As%20Enacted.pdf"&gt; bill here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside this, we tested the lead levels in all the faucets and taps in Sunderland and Coffrin Hall. While testing isn’t mandated for colleges under this bill, our environmental chemistry class had found elevated levels of lead in these buildings, which is why we decided to test them in the summer. Around 40 percent of the taps we tested in these two buildings required attention. We reported our findings to facilities, which then removed and replaced all the fixtures.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;figure class="paragraph--quote"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;
                  &lt;blockquote class="quote quote__text"&gt;
            &lt;span class="quote--marks"&gt;
                One of my goals is to help people in my community, and I feel that working on this research project has helped me accomplish this goal.

            &lt;/span&gt;
                      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Testing Middlebury’s buildings has shown the local impact of this law and contributed to the safety of Middlebury’s staff, faculty, and my fellow students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into this summer, I had no knowledge of data programming or lead-testing procedures. Now I am confident in my ability as a data analyzer and environmental researcher. This experience sets me apart from others in my field and forms a strong foundation of skills that heighten my capabilities. I am excited to continue using and building upon the skills I have acquired as I continue at Middlebury and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
