              &lt;h2&gt;  Connor Wertz ’22 came to Middlebury with an interest in the environment. He is leaving as an experienced environmental activist excited to be part of advancing the climate movement.
&lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;“As an environmental justice major, I’ve gained worlds of information and background that has helped me see the problem—and the many potential solutions—in a whole new light,” he says. “Helping to connect the disparate societal ills of our time to coherent and exciting visions of the future feels so rich and fulfilling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wertz is a member of the Sunday Night Environmental Group and SGA Environmental Sustainability Committee. He spent a summer interning at 350VT—the Vermont arm of 350.org, the organization co-founded by Schumann Scholar in Residence Bill McKibben and Middlebury students. Now, Wertz is a member of the 350VT board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wertz’s Middlebury experience was made possible, in part, by the Barefoot Family Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not being buried in debt has been the greatest gift of my college experience. It has given me the flexibility to take risks and find balance between what I want to do and what is needed of me. Opportunities like Middlebury can change the trajectory of people’s lives. I will not waste this experience.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;span&gt;The Power of Words&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Mon, 05/09/2022 - 15:41&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;div class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
          &lt;div class="paragraph--lead lead"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;h2&gt;  Middlebury students are learning the art of oratory to make their words mean more. An innovative program has already helped more than 7,000 students deliver compelling arguments, enrich class discussions, and impress at job interviews.
&lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
          &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Words matter. But as a playwright, Associate Professor Dana Yeaton ’79 also knows that how you say them can matter just as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompted by an alumni survey that highlighted a need for training in public speaking, he set out to make that an integral part of the Middlebury experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is Oratory Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past eight years, more than 7,300 students have learned to deliver compelling arguments, tell captivating stories, nail job interviews, enrich class discussions, and enjoy everyday conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;

    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oratory Now provides peer tutoring and professional development; offers a credit-bearing physical education course; and collaborates on workshops, podcasts, curricula, and community-speaking events. Yeaton describes it as “student-driven, faculty-led oratory training.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, Yeaton partnered with other professors to hold workshops when students had upcoming presentations. As more students became interested, Yeaton began bringing in students to help him run the workshops. In short order, he says, the students began leading the workshops. “The protocol became the students go; I don’t go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That insight led to the development of the peer-coach program, which has enabled Oratory Now to grow exponentially and given hundreds of students the opportunity to become oratory coaches. Each coach must do at least nine hours of training. New coaches are trained by more experienced head coaches, who take them through an oratory boot camp. They are supported in this work by Dana and by Ben Powers, Oratory Now associate.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;

    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;“Students just continue to raise the level of engagement and surprise themselves with what they can do and what they can get each other to do,” Powers says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student coaches hold in-class workshops to help peers prepare for presentations, work with local organizations and global businesses to train their employees, and oversee annual speech competitions. Some coaches, Yeaton says, have logged more than 1,000 hours by the time they graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oratory Now has been a key part of the Middlebury experience for head-coach-in-training Seth Brown ’24. Seth joined Oratory Now after competing in the Spencer Prize competition, a speech competition exclusively for first-years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They reached out,” he says, “and I liked the support structure that they provided for all the speakers, so I decided to join up.” Since then, Brown has gone on to co-executive produce the Spencer Prize and serve as a coach for classroom sessions. Oratory Now, he says, “is applicable to any course of study. Almost all classes require you to do presentations, to regularly communicate with your professors.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;figure class="media media--image media--contain-caption"&gt;&lt;img data-original-image-width="2190" data-original-image-height="1230" srcset="https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/400x225/public/2022-05/College-People-2022-Oratory-Now-Peer-Workshop-Feature-3-1136X638.jpeg?itok=7PjcgWLa 400w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/640x360/public/2022-05/College-People-2022-Oratory-Now-Peer-Workshop-Feature-3-1136X638.jpeg?itok=6uxMiJEm 640w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/832x468/public/2022-05/College-People-2022-Oratory-Now-Peer-Workshop-Feature-3-1136X638.jpeg?itok=fijImage 832w, https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/1136x639/public/2022-05/College-People-2022-Oratory-Now-Peer-Workshop-Feature-3-1136X638.jpeg?itok=YqWxZQ7z 1136w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px" src="https://www.middlebury.edu/campaign/sites/www.middlebury.edu.campaign/files/styles/1136x639/public/2022-05/College-People-2022-Oratory-Now-Peer-Workshop-Feature-3-1136X638.jpeg?itok=YqWxZQ7z" alt="A red-haired student in a floral purple shirt is mid movement as she leads a peer oratory workshop." /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="media__caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;What’s ahead for Brown? “I’m excited to take up more leadership positions within Oratory Now and help craft it into something that everyone on campus recognizes and wants to be a part of,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oratory Now is also central to life at Middlebury for head coach Kamari Williams ’22.5. “I always had a passion for public speaking,” she says, “so when I found the Oratory Now job, I jumped on it because it sounded so amazing.” Williams has gone on to produce events, run Oratory Now social channels, and collaborate with the &lt;em&gt;New England Review&lt;/em&gt;. In doing so, she has developed professional skills and built a community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oratory Now has also put Williams’s future into focus. “We’ve learned this through the pandemic, but the ability of people in STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) to be able to speak to the general public about complex things is really important,” she says. “That’s something I want to try and do in my work, to help those in STEM communicate clearly with the general public.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;

    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dana points to the hiring of Ben Powers—with his background in communication and leadership at local and global organizations—as a turning point in Oratory Now’s development. Yeaton must balance his work as a faculty member with his duties with Oratory Now. Having a full-time staff member has made it possible to deepen classroom connections and expand beyond academics to prepare students for careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oratory Now started as the answer to a need,” Yeaton says. “Our hope is that it sustains enough support to continue expanding services, so every Middlebury student graduates ready to speak their truths to the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Programs At a Glance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oratory Now offers a roster of 10+ public-speaking services and events. The following are a sampling of those programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classroom coaching:&lt;/strong&gt; The foundational service, classroom coaching is how Oratory Now collaborates with faculty to meet specific class needs. Head coaches tailor approaches for given assignments and subjects and then hold in-class workshops to help their peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spencer Prize:&lt;/strong&gt; A speech competition exclusively for first-year students, the Spencer Prize is a first chance for new students to hone their public speaking. It is also a touchpoint for Oratory Now to connect with new students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oratory Alliance:&lt;/strong&gt; Described as “the professional sister company,” Oratory Alliance is a wing of the organization that takes classroom coaching and refashions it for working spaces. The goal is to show student coaches how to translate their classroom experiences into professional possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parker-Merrill Speech Competition:&lt;/strong&gt; First held in 1825, the Parker-Merrill Speech Competition is a student speech competition that challenges contestants to write and deliver a speech inspired by a prompt. After running up to 1965, the competition disappeared &lt;a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/announcements/news/2016/04/student-group-revives-speech-contest-after-50-year-hiatus-video"&gt;until Oratory Now revived it in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>What It Takes to Triumph</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;What It Takes to Triumph&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;haquyenp@middl…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Thu, 05/05/2022 - 16:23&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;div class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
          &lt;div class="paragraph--lead lead"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;h2&gt;  Middlebury women’s lacrosse has thrilled fans—season after season. Integral to that success—a full-time assistant coach, made possible by an endowed fund.
&lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For Dani Ellis, a full-time assistant coach of the varsity women’s lacrosse team—undefeated in regular season play and runner-up in the NESCAC finals—there is no such thing as a typical nine-to-five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On any given day during the season, Ellis might be found analyzing practice footage and film from opponents’ games, answering recruitment emails, taking phone calls and Zoom meetings, strategizing practice drills with head coach Kate Livesay ’03 and part-time assistant coach Amy Patton, managing parent volunteers, booking hotels, planning post-game food orders so players can have meals—the list goes on. And when a player needs to talk, plans can change in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The student-athletes are why we’re here, so no matter how long that takes, that’s the time you need to spend,” Ellis says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this before the team sets foot on the field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People think, ‘Oh, you coach—you have practices and games,’” Ellis says. “But that’s maybe 10 percent of the job, and just during the fall and the spring. The rest of the year we’re on the road, recruiting. It doesn’t stop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hard work has paid off this year as the team was ranked number one going into postseason play—a stunning comeback after two years’ pandemic-related hiatus.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;figure class="paragraph--quote"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;
                  &lt;blockquote class="quote quote__text"&gt;
            &lt;span class="quote--marks"&gt;
                A full-time assistant coach is one of the hardest positions out there, responsible for all the behind-the-scenes work.

            &lt;/span&gt;
                          &lt;figcaption class="quote__cite"&gt;—   Kate Livesay, Women’s Lacrosse Head Coach
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Student-athlete Emma White ’22 says assistant coaches like Ellis are critical to team cohesion and provide an important bridge between players and the head coach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It can be intimidating to go to the head coach if you’re having problems,” White says. “The assistant coaches are more approachable, and they bring an individual focus to each player. The head coach’s job is the big picture. The assistant coach has the flexibility to check in with people, really get to know players one on one, and figure out what motivates them—creating individual relationships that can help each person thrive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collaboration among members of the coaching staff helps model the kind of teamwork players require for the whole team to succeed, Livesay says—no small thing in a sport built on cooperation and trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The players see the way that we support each other and how important that is to our being able to give our best,” she says. “Lacrosse is not a one-woman show—it’s about working together to make magic happen on the field. It breeds this ideal of working collectively as a group that players love, and that extends to how they feel about Middlebury.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;“Full-time assistant coaches with a competitive salary are critical for the successful operation of each of our varsity programs, from game planning to recruiting the next class of exceptional student-athletes,” says Director of Athletics Erin Quinn, explaining why endowed support for assistant coaches—for every Middlebury team—is an essential campaign priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellis herself says she was drawn to Middlebury’s lacrosse program in part because she sees the value the College places on its athletics teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a place where women’s sports, especially, are given resources, and that allows us to do the work that we need to do as coaches to excel,” she says. “As a woman who is helping to lead other women, I think that is just amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Connecting Academics and Experience</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Connecting Academics and Experience&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;yanderson@midd…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Wed, 05/04/2022 - 14:59&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;div class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
          &lt;div class="paragraph--lead lead"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;h2&gt;  Sophomore Cassia Park’s summer internship at the HOPE Food Shelf in Addison County changed how she sees herself and her place in the world. The internship was part of her studies in the Privilege and Poverty Academic Cluster.
&lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Park always knew she had an interest in the environment and food. But “being in nature, seeing where food comes from and how it’s grown and picked, how it comes to the food shelf, and then putting it out for clients, that’s really interesting to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working at HOPE has “helped me connect to the Middlebury community inside the town and not just the college,” she says. “It helps me put things into perspective of what I want from the school and what I want to do in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Park is an environmental justice major, who plans a career in place-based education. In summer 2022, she will take the next step on that journey as an intern at Shelburne Farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Privilege and Poverty helped me see myself as able to be an advocate for others like my family who have sometimes struggled getting food,” Park says. “The internship helped me see how I can translate my interests into a professional career.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Learning Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park’s internship was one of 12 offered as part of Middlebury’s &lt;a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/office/community-engagement/programs/signature-programs/privilege-poverty"&gt;Privilege &amp; Poverty Academic Cluster&lt;/a&gt; last summer. Administered by the Middlebury Center for Community Engagement (CCE), the Privilege &amp; Poverty Academic Cluster is more than an academic program—it is a learning community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students explore the causes and consequences of economic inequality through over 160 courses offered by 20 academic departments. They also participate in discussions and events outside class, so they can connect with like-minded peers across disciplines. Students then take what they’ve learned into summer internships at organizations addressing economic inequality in their local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cluster is not a formal major or minor, but it is a program with coherence, relevance, and intellectual depth that complements any other major course of study. Participating faculty include a range of professors from across academic disciplines so that students study specific interests with depth, breadth, and connection.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Service Record&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 16 years, more than 150 students have worked with communities addressing the causes and consequences of economic inequality in Privilege &amp; Poverty internships. They have done so at 100 national organizations, and 10 local organizations in Addison County. In total, that amounts to nearly 50,000 hours in partnership with practitioners, community members, and peers, collaborating to confront issues of inequality with directness and empathy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interns work with organizations and communities around the world, but CCE also connects students with opportunities in Middlebury’s backyard. Former WomenSafe Executive Director Kerri Duquette-Hoffman notes that Privilege &amp; Poverty interns allowed the Vermont-based program to “grow as an agency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We learn so much from the students, who understand our work but also have an outside perspective,” she says. “The questions that the students bring are such a gift…in addition to the huge help that they give.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Privilege &amp; Poverty interns meet weekly as a cohort with affiliated staff, faculty, and community partners. These gatherings encourage group reflections on individual work, intersections of experience, and insights on broader themes that emerge during discussions. This combination of theory and practice ensures that the learning community extends well beyond the classroom and individual internships. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;span&gt;For People and Planet&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;yanderson@midd…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Fri, 04/29/2022 - 16:10&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;div class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
          &lt;div class="paragraph--lead lead"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;h2&gt;  A summer internship at the Vermont Natural Resources Council helped to launch Terry Kellogg ’94 on a career that has changed how companies do business.
&lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For nearly three decades, Kellogg has worked and studied at the intersection of business and the environment. His focus areas have included forestry, mining, renewable energy and sustainable business practices writ large at the Timberland Company, 1% for the Planet, and now Helios Climate Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An internship at the Vermont Natural Resources Council (VNRC), funded by the Ronald H. Brown ’62 Internship Program, set him on that path, Kellogg says. “I can draw a clear arc from that summer in 1994 to each of the career steps I took from there through many facets of the business and environmental landscape.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;figure class="paragraph--quote"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;
                  &lt;blockquote class="quote quote__text"&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;
                There was no road map for doing this kind of thing at the time so we had to figure it out as we went. I got used to the idea that work, in general, must be that way: understand the objective and then just figure out a way to get there.

            &lt;/span&gt;
                      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kellogg spent the summer creating GIS maps of timber harvesting practices in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont following a significant land ownership change in the region. “To this day, I can hardly believe that I had the chance to dive into something that big during a summer internship,” Kellogg says. “The stark representation in those maps changed the conversation about forest management practices in Vermont and beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As director of environmental stewardship at Timberland, Kellogg reduced the company’s carbon footprint, adopted widespread use of water-based adhesives, and launched programs in green building and organic cotton. He also created systems for rating and managing the impact of materials, products and suppliers, initiatives that placed Timberland at the forefront of the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As CEO of Patagonia’s 1% for the Planet, Kellogg grew the organization from a concept with 92 members to a global network with 1,400 companies in 44 nations that funneled in excess of $100MM to environmental causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cofounder and managing director of Helios, Kellogg looks for opportunities that will reshape industries, sustain planetary health, and offer outsized returns to investors. Helios invests in climate-friendly technologies, focusing on a small number of early-stage, high-impact, high-return investment opportunities. The firm has raised five funds since 2019 for a total of $38.4 million and invested in several early-stage energy storage, solar, and artificial technology companies and currently has $300 million in assets under management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did your internship entail?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I helped to create GIS maps of timber harvesting practices in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont following a significant land ownership change in the region. The work required me to spend time in a Forest Service office in Northern Vermont tracing orthographic photographs, then “ground truthing” the images. We also partnered with an organization called Light Hawk to perform aerial flyovers of the land, using a float plane and taking off from a tiny lake in the middle of the woods. I had weekly progress check-ins at the VNRC offices in Montpelier but the work was largely mine to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you gain specific skills that you carried forward? What were the biggest personal or professional takeaways?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There was no road map for doing this kind of thing at the time so we had to figure it out as we went. I got used to the idea that work in general must be that way: understand the objective and then just figure out a way to get there. The stakes were high and there was a lot of autonomy. I suppose the experience helped me to become accustomed to such things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What impact did this experience have on your future personal or professional choices?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It was formative to be sure. I can draw a clear arc from that summer to each of the career steps I took from there through many facets of the business and environment landscape. Albeit less field-oriented, all of my work has focused on the interplay between people and planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even to this day, the scope and impact of the project feels big for a summer internship. The stark representation in those maps changed the conversation about forest management practices in Vermont. I also think fondly of the many legendary figures in conservation that were connected to VNRC at the time. Two young directors went on to lead major New England conservation groups. One sidebar trip for me entailed a long detour to help a beloved senior staff member plug in a new computer and install a dial-up modem at his house for the first time!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Safer Vermont Schools</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Safer Vermont Schools&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;yanderson@midd…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Tue, 02/01/2022 - 17:43&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;div class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
          &lt;div class="paragraph--lead lead"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;h2&gt;  During the summer of 2021, Evelyn Lane ’23 worked with a Middlebury professor on a research project examining lead levels in water at schools across Vermont. In conjunction with a 2019 Vermont law focused on lead, her work has resulted in safer water supplies throughout the state.
&lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A junior environmental chemistry major, Evelyn Lane ’23 worked with Professor Molly Costanza-Robinson to analyze the impact of Vermont’s school lead laws. The following is Evelyn’s reflection on the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn:&lt;/strong&gt; My research partner and I worked on determining the impact of the 2019 Vermont law that concerns lead testing and remediation in schools. Through discussions with the Vermont Department of Health and Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, we organized and analyzed a database that is essential to determining how Vermont’s lead laws have affected children’s blood lead levels. You can read the&lt;a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2020/Docs/ACTS/ACT066/ACT066%20As%20Enacted.pdf"&gt; bill here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside this, we tested the lead levels in all the faucets and taps in Sunderland and Coffrin Hall. While testing isn’t mandated for colleges under this bill, our environmental chemistry class had found elevated levels of lead in these buildings, which is why we decided to test them in the summer. Around 40 percent of the taps we tested in these two buildings required attention. We reported our findings to facilities, which then removed and replaced all the fixtures.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;figure class="paragraph--quote"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;
                  &lt;blockquote class="quote quote__text"&gt;
            &lt;span class="quote--marks"&gt;
                One of my goals is to help people in my community, and I feel that working on this research project has helped me accomplish this goal.

            &lt;/span&gt;
                      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph--text text"&gt;
    
    
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
              &lt;div class="text--container"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Testing Middlebury’s buildings has shown the local impact of this law and contributed to the safety of Middlebury’s staff, faculty, and my fellow students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into this summer, I had no knowledge of data programming or lead-testing procedures. Now I am confident in my ability as a data analyzer and environmental researcher. This experience sets me apart from others in my field and forms a strong foundation of skills that heighten my capabilities. I am excited to continue using and building upon the skills I have acquired as I continue at Middlebury and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
